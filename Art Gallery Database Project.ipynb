    "Museums and art gallery plays a major role in our life and our community. For instances, it serves as the bridge to connect us with our past and to preserve our history and cultural heritage.

New York, London and Berlin are home to 16% of all galleries worldwide.\n",

    "Now, the idea for The Art Gallery Database Project stemmed from my appreciation of museums and art gallery. This project will only displayed an *extremely small* list of paintings that are currently exhibited at museums from different countries, such as UK, Norway and US. It is never the aim of this project to even covered an extensive list of the paintings that are exhibited at a certain museum. Instead, I am going to hand picked several paintings and their painters from various museum locations. Some paintings might even owned by private collectors."
