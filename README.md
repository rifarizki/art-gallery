# Creating A Simple Art Gallery Database Project

Hi, and welcome to my first personal project in using MySQL.

In this project, I tried to create a very simple database that would store data about paintings from different artists in different art galleries/museums.
The location scope of the museums were limited to the US and Europe only.
The database itself contains two tables, namely the `artists` and `artworks` table where as the names suggested, each table would have several columns, either about the details
of a work (table `artworks`) or its painters (table `artists`). I'm using the sqlite3 package, an in-built SQL module for Python.
